# Motion detector
A Python program that uses a camera feed to constantly monitor and detect any movement within its field of view. Upon identifying motion, this program displays where the motion happens live video feed itself. This involves comparing multiple frames with each other and detecting the differcres and highlighting the particular part of the video. 

The main adavantage of the program is that it detects even the most minor changes happening in the enivornment, making it a very sensitive motion detector.
